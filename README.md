# RPS
- Rock, paper, scissors (node assignment)

## Partisipatioons
- The partisipations in this project is Antons Börnfelt and Allan Tran.

## The Project
- Our focus in this project is connecting people to be able to have a fun time together evern though you are not with eachother.

## The Game
- We have been thinking about what kind of project we wanted to make. There were alot of      ideas but we decided to go with the classic game: "Rock Paper Scissors".
- The idea is that there is two player that plays against each other, and the game is best of five games. 
- First to tree points wins.
- With the help of websocket, we will be able to make the connection betweeen two persons.

## What we could do if there is time?


## How does it work?
- As for now, you have to connect with put repo in github.
- Make a git pull
- In Vs Codes terminal write the following: node server.js
- You should get this: WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080
- Then in the project mapp double click on index.html.
- Wait for an opponent

## How we build the project?
- We use Javascript, some html but mainly javascript.

## Deployment
- We struggled a bit with the deployment part. At first we tried to deploy in vercell, the deploying part was no problem. But apparently vercell doesnt support websocket. In which we decided to deploy in render as well.
- vercell is hosting frontend ( Html, Css, client.js)
- render is hosting backend (Node, WebSocket server)
