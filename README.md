Rock, paper, scissors (node assignment)

## Partisipatioons
The partisipations in this project is Antons Börnfelt and Allan Tran.

## The Project
Our focus in this project is connecting people to be able to have a fun time together evern though you are not with eachother.

## The Game
We have been thinking about what kind of project we wanted to make. There were alot of ideas but we decided to go with the classic game: "Rock Paper Scissors".
The idea is that there is two player that plays against each other, and the game is best of five games. So first to tree points wins.
With the help of websocket, we will be able to make the connection betweeen two persons.

## What we could do if there is time?
It would be nice to singelplayer function, so if the player for some reasons can't find an opponent then the player will play agianst a bot.
